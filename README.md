This function takes two arrays of geolocations and matches each point in the first array to the closest point in the second array using the Haversine formula to calculate distances.

# **Requirements**
Python 3.6 or higher

# **How to Use**

1. Clone the repository => git clone https://github.com/mirayayerdem/EC530_Assignment1.git  
2. Go to this folder => cd EC530_Assignment1  
3. Use any Python-compatible IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code) to open the find_distance.py file.  
4. The script will prompt you to enter geolocation coordinates in the following format:  
	•	Each location is given as <latitude,longitude>.  
	•	Separate multiple locations with spaces.  
	•	Example input: 34.45,25.35 -12.26,34.99  
5. The script will display the closest points and their distances in kilometers.
